 Idk what is this.
 All what I can tell you is just what I want to learn the Programms language for make my own project. 
 Currently I learning the C# for Unity. 
 But when I finished it, I would start learn the other main Programm languages for GameDev: 
  â€”â€”C++ for Unreal Engine (But only for 4 version of Engine, not for 5. Because my comp is very bad for UE5), 
  â€”â€”Python for PyGame, 
  â€”â€”GDScript for Godot,
  â€”â€”and UnigineScript for UnigineScript. 
 If you interested about my project, I tell you - that is will be game. 
 Big game. 

That's all. 


 





















And yeah - I'm ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º. Don't bully me for my low level of knowledge in English, just only because I will not understand you.
